# Aerotrader Flight Pricing Simulator

Welcome to the Aerotrader Flight Pricing Simulator project! This repository provides a flexible, extensible framework for simulating stock price movement as aircraft flight, using real market data and aviation-inspired metaphors. The project is designed for researchers, educators, and quantitative traders interested in novel ways to visualize and analyze market behavior.

## Project Overview

- **Modular Engine (`modular/`)**: The main, production-ready simulation engine. Highly modular, with each component (data loading, turbulence, stall detection, etc.) separated for clarity and extensibility. Use this for robust research, backtesting, and advanced experimentation.
- **FlightOps Orchestrator (`modular/core/flight_ops_core.py`)**: The unified orchestrator that manages cross-domain simulation, event triggers, and state synchronization between market, aircraft, and traffic domains. Enables advanced multi-agent and event-driven simulation scenarios.
- **Standalone Scripts (`standalone/`)**: Experimental and legacy versions of the engine. These scripts are ideal for rapid prototyping, learning, and exploring different approaches to flight-based market simulation. Each version demonstrates a different stage of development or feature set.

## Key Features
- Simulates stock price movement as a "flight," with altitude, fuel, turbulence, and stall events mapped to market metrics.
- Supports both daily (macro cruise) and synthetic intraday (jet flight) simulation modes.
- Outputs detailed markdown and JSON logs, including flight summaries and telemetry tables.
- Generates printable reports with plots and candle phase tables.
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation.
- - Unified event-driven simulation via `flight_ops_core.py` for research-grade multi-domain modeling.
- Cross-domain event triggers: market, aircraft, and traffic domains can now influence each other (e.g., market stall triggers aircraft stall, traffic go-around triggers aircraft holding, holding triggers cleared-to-land).
- Each flight tracks a rolling telemetry/history buffer for time-series analysis and visualization.

## Directory Structure
- `modular/` — Main modular engine, entry point, logs, and documentation
- `modular/core/` — All core simulation modules and logic
- `modular/logs/` — All simulation log output (markdown and JSON)
- `standalone/` — Experimental and legacy scripts for reference and prototyping
- `development/` — Progress logs, templates, and project management

## Getting Started

### Running the Modular Engine
Use the entry point for all simulations:
```bash
python modular/entry.py [--mode daily|intraday] [--ticker TICKER] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--log-format markdown|json]
```
Logs are saved to `modular/logs/`.

#### Cross-Domain Event Triggers
The simulation now supports cross-domain triggers:
- If a market flight enters stall, the corresponding aircraft is also set to stall.
- If a traffic flight enters a 'GoAround' phase, the corresponding aircraft is set to 'Holding'.
- If an aircraft remains in 'Holding' for more than 2 ticks, the corresponding traffic flight is set to 'ClearedToLand'.

#### Telemetry/History Buffer
Each flight object maintains a rolling buffer of its last 10 states (altitude, velocity, phase, status flags, price), enabling time-series analysis and visualization.

### Running Standalone Scripts
Navigate to the `standalone/` directory and run any of the `flight_sim_enginevX.py` scripts directly:
```bash
python standalone/flight_sim_enginev3.py
```
Logs are saved to `
